<h6>NOVEMBER 23, 2125</h6>

<h2>I never loved you.</h2>

<p class="quoteblock">Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Kif might! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>

<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Why did you bring us here? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! So, how 'bout them Knicks? It's toe-tappingly tragic! Negative, bossy meat creature! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Actually, that's still true. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>

<h2>Who are those horrible orange men?</h2>

<div class="postblock">

<p class="quoteblock">But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. You can see how I lived before I met you. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Can I use the gun? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p>

<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? It's a T. It goes "tuh". Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. You're going to do his laundry? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>

<h6>MONTH OF THE WALRUS, 2125</h6>

<h2>I wish! It's a nickel.</h2>


<p class="quoteblock">Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>

<p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

Your best is an idiot!
Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
It doesn't look so shiny to me. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Professor, make a woman out of me.
Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
Kif might!
But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Fatal. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
